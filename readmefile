# Simple DevOps Project

This is a simple DevOps project consisting of a React front-end and a Node.js back-end API.

## Front-End

The front-end is a simple React app that fetches user data from the back-end API and displays it.

To run the front-end locally:
1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
